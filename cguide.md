This work is inspired by many existing coding standards and our own
experience in C software development and understanding of foreign source
code. Most notable documents which have been used to create this
standard are:

-   L. W. Cannon, R. A. Elliot et. al. “Recommended C Style and Coding
    Standards” (based on Indian Hill C Style and Coding Standard).

-   R. Stallman “GNU Coding Standards” (March 2010, (C) Free Software
    Foundation)

-   J. K. Ousterhout Tcl/Tk Engineering Manual

-   WRS Coding Conventions

-   Doxygen manual

-   MISRA:C 2012 (Guidelines for safe C programming for embedded systems)

Introduction
============

The main purpose of this standard is to define a framework which can
help us to develop source code in a clear and uniform manner. Another
goal is to define a base for automatic generation of convenient on-line
and printable documentation directly from sources.

This document defines the “low-level” C coding conventions, structure of
C source files, naming conventions, commenting style which must be
applied to developing of C source code. We have tried not only give a
pandect of rules, but also give rationale and reasons for some of them.

Doxygen-specific guidelines concerning resulting documentation
formatting and common issues will be described in a separate document.

General
=======

Style remarks
-------------

C language has a pretty simple syntax, nevertheless it is possible to
write extremely complicated code. The following example, taken from
“Obfuscated C Contest” archive, is a correct C program; you can try to
compile and execute it:

    main() { printf(&unix["\021%six\012\0"],(unix)["have"]+"fun"-0x60); }

How much time you need to understand how it works? :-)

It is good for fun, but absolutely not applicable for development of a
big software project, which must be supported by many people during several
years. Your code may be read by many people, and it is very important to
make your code understandable for them. Every time have in mind that you
are writing code not for the compiler, but for the human. Limit your fantasy to
keep your code clear.

Text width
----------

Any line of C source code shouldn’t be longer than 80 characters.

Remember that during debugging and further development of your program
you often insert additional `if` statements moving your original code
more and more to the right. Try to keep your original code in 60–70
character limit.

If C source code is generated by other programs, tools, scripts, and
the produced code is not intended to be human-readable, it is not required
to follow 80 character limitation.

File length
-----------

Source code file length is not limited explicitly. More important aspect
in division of source code to many files is to reflect logical structure
of a specific program or project. Nevertheless, each file must have a
reasonable size. It is not possible to give hard limitations of source
length; it seems that 800–4000 lines of code is a good source size and
up to 6000–8000 lines is acceptable.

If C source code is generated by other programs, tools, scripts, the
file length is not limited.

Special Characters
------------------

Lines in source file are separated by character `LF` (hex code 0x0a).
It is not allowed to use MS-DOS standard `CR-LF` sequence for line
delimiting.

It is permitted (but not required) to insert `FF` character (Form
Feed, hex code 0x0c) to separate logically independent parts of source
code (functions or function groups, variable declaration groups, etc).
This character shall not be used inside function body.

It is prohibited to use control characters immediately in string
constants or comments. For strings you may use escape sequences instead.

Do not forget to setup your text editor program so that it will insert
appropriate number of spaces instead of `TAB` (hex code 0x09)
character on TAB key pressing.

Trigraphs
---------

Do not ever use the “trigraphs” feature of ISO C. (If you don’t know
what does it mean – don’t worry, it will be better if you never know
about it).

Indentation
-----------

Indentation is used to show structure of algorithms or data types.
Usually, each statement in complex statement is started at the same
column, and each nested statement is indented relative to its “parent”.
Precise rules specific to each C language construct provided below.

Indentation level is 4 character. It means that every nested block
shifted to 4 character right relatively to the position of its “parent
block”.

If a nested block is a complex statement surrounded with curly brackets
(braces), these brackets must be placed at the position of “parent”
block.

The following example demonstrates this:

        while (p != NULL)
        {
            for (i = 0; i < p->tabsize; i++)
            {
                if (p->tab[i] == x)
                    return i;
            }
            return 0;
        }

Vertical spacing
----------------

-   Use blank lines to make code more readable. Group logically related
    sections of code together.

-   It is not recommended to put more than one declaration to the line.
    (It is allowed to put two-three declarations of tightly-related
    variables in one line to emphasise their relationship).

-   It is *highly not recommended* to put more than one statement on a
    line. (It is allowed to put two-three very simple and
    tightly-related actions (something like i++; j++;) on the one line.)
    Exception: `for` statement, when initial, condition and loop
    statement could be written on a single line; see templates below.

-   Curvy braces ({ and }) always (except `do...while` loop) get their
    own line.

Trailing whitespace
-------------------

There should no trailing whitespace. There are many ways this could be ensured:
- many code editors can be configured to highlight them
  (e.g. `show-trailing-whitespace` option in Emacs or
  `let c_space_errors = 1` in Vim)
- Reviewboard does highlight them
- `git diff --check`
- the default Git pre-commit hook does the above check automatically
- specific projects may have additional hooks or check scripts

General punctuation rules
-------------------------

If a description is a complete sentence, it must start with an upper-case letter
and end with a dot. If a description is just a nominal phrase (e.g. it describes
an object and has no finite verb form), which is common for parameter
descriptions and other enumeration-like entities, then it must start with
a lower-case letter (save for acronyms, of course) and have no punctuation sign
at the end. In a list of descriptions all of them shall be either sentences or
nominal phrases. Of course, if a description consists of several sentences, they
all must be formatted as sentences.

```
/* Good */
/** The description of an enum. */
typedef enum some_enum {
    SOME_ENUM_ITEM_1, /**< first item */
    SOME_ENUM_ITEM_2, /**< second item */
} some_enum;

/* Acceptable */
/** The description of an enum. */
typedef enum some_enum {
    SOME_ENUM_ITEM_1, /**< First item. */
    SOME_ENUM_ITEM_2, /**< Second item. */
} some_enum;

/* Wrong */
/** The description of an enum (no dot) */
typedef enum some_enum {
    SOME_ENUM_ITEM_1, /**< First item. */
    SOME_ENUM_ITEM_2, /**< second item (differs from the first) */
} some_enum;
```

Rules for formatting specific kinds of entities may pose additional requirements
on the form of their descriptions, see below.

Brief descriptions of top-level Doxygen comments shall always end with a dot,
because otherwise Doxygen may get confused.

Standards compliance
====================

Unless there are specific project requirements, all the code should assume
being compiled with an ISO C99-compliant compiler (as are all modern versions of
gcc and clang versions, and even more recent Microsoft compilers).
It is not feasible to require strict adherence to the published standard, however,
as a general rule, if something can be done in a standard-compliant way, it should be
done this way (in most cases the compiler would warn you if you deviate from the
standard too much). So the support for things such as `inline` keyword or `<stdint.h>`
should be taken for granted, and no special checks or workarounds should be employed
when using them.

Here are some interesting features from C99 that may be used to improve code quality:

-   **Compound literals.** These are the method of constructing structure/union and array
    objects on the fly. Technically they are equivalent to temporary variables of a given
    types, which means that the address of it may be taken and e. g. passed to a function.
    This makes it very convenient to use with functions that take structure/union pointers
    as arguments.
-   **Named initialisers.** These can be used in three way:
    + Named initialisers on structure values allow the structure fields to be named explicitly
      and so make the code both more readable and more robust against adding new structure fields
      in the future (note, however, that there is a slight drawback here: compilers usually won't
      warn you about missing initialisers in the case of named initialisers)
    + Named initialisers on union values is the only portable and reliable way to initialise other
      union fields but the first one.
    + Named initialisers on array values may be used in two cases:
      + when an array is enum-indexed to avoid tight coupling with the order of enum values
      + to initialise only certain values in a large array, making the compiler to initialise the
        rest with all-zeroes.

There some C99 features that should be avoided, though. The reason for it is simple: some older, but still
widely used `gcc` versions refuse to accept them in the “default” mode, required special compiler flags
like `-std=gnu99`:

- **Mixing declarations and code.** In most cases it's better to use explicit scoping, e. g. putting a piece
  of code into a separate function. However, this can be useful with debugging macros, like:

        int function(int arg)
        {
            ENTRY("%d", arg);
            int var = expr(arg);
        }

- **Declarations inside the `for` head.** If ever used, this feature should be restricted to `for` loops
  used inside complex macros.

-  **Flexible structure members.** The last element of the structure may be declared as an “open” array,
   using just a `[]` without the size. This is a pretty useful way to declare structures that have a fixed
   header and a variable-length payload (such as network packets). The main advantage of this construction
   is that the size of the object is easier to calculate: pre-C99 way of declaring such objects was to have
   a 1-sized array as the last element, so it need to be subtracted:

        struct pkt_s {
            unsigned n_elem;
            datatype elems[1]
        } *pkt;
        size = sizeof(struct pkt_s) - sizeof(pkt->elems) + pkt->n_elem * sizeof(*pkt->elems);

   whereas with the C99 declaration it goes like this:

        struct pkt_s {
            unsigned n_elem;
            datatype elems[]
        } *pkt;
        size = sizeof(struct pkt_s) + pkt->n_elem * sizeof(*pkt->elems);

   Note that a variable, even a local one, cannot be declared with a type that contains the last flexible
   member.

   GCC supported this feature before C99 in a slightly different way, namely allowing the last array field in
   a struct to have zero size (that is, it would be `datatype elems[0]`, not `datatype elems[]`.

   Unfortunately, it is known that some versions of GCC do have a bug causing the size of a structure
   with a flexible member to be improperly calculated, and the old `[0]` syntax may not be accepted by
   more recent compilers. Therefore the use of this construction, though mildly useful, is discouraged
   in the general case. If the structure does not represent external data, such as a network packet, it
   is recommended to use a pointer to actual payload, instead of embedding it directly into the structure.


POSIX programming environment
-----------------------------

In most cases it is safe to assume that the target system provides POSIX-compatible environment. Note that
most open-source operating systems, both GNU/Linux and BSD-based, are not formally POSIX-certified, but
for most practical purposes they should be considered compliant. (Also the policy of Austin Group that
supervises the development of POSIX standards has recently been to prey upon Linux API and standardize
things from it). Still APIs that are marked as POSIX 2008 or later should be used with caution, as there
are still many systems in production that may not support such features or support them inadequately.

There are some assumptions on the underlying hardware that are either mandated by the POSIX or actually
do hold for all existing POSIX-compatible systems:

- the minimum addressable memory unit is a 8-bit byte (still it is preferred to use `CHAR_BIT` to refer to
  the number of bits in the byte, rather than an explicit number)
- integer arithmetics is two's-complement and integer overflow is always silent
- `int` is at least 32-bits wide (but still no assumptions should be made on its exact width, see the section
  on data types)
- 8-, 16-, 32- and 64-bit integers are available
- all pointers have the same size and the same representation, which in particular means that a pointer to
  function may be cast to and from `void *` safely (which is not warranted by ISO C99)
- all-zero bits is equivalent to `NULL` pointer constant and to floating point `0.0`, therefore filling a structure
  with zeroes is always a valid way of initalising it
- dereferencing `NULL` pointer results in the program being immediately killed
- variadic functions has the same calling convention as non-variadic ones, so a non-variadic function can be safely
  called through a variadic function pointer, provided that the caller actually supplies the correct number of arguments

Also in all POSIX-compatible systems a process is an isolated entity and its resources such as the memory and
open files are always reclaimed by the system at exit. Therefore, it is not strictly required to release them
manually, though it is still recommended to do so explicitly, so that the analytic tools like `valgrind` should
not be confused.

C11 features
------------

The compiler/library support for the latest C11 standard is still weaker than for the C99, so the new features
from C11 should be used with discretion, their availability should be checked and a workaround for earlier systems
should be provided. Note that most compilers required a specific flag (like `-stdc=c11`) to accept C11-specific
constructions.

Here is a list of C11 features with comments:

- `noreturn` qualifier may be applied to functions that never return to the caller (like `abort()` or `longjmp()`).
  It can be used iff the equivalent of the following is put somewhere in the project headers:

        #if __STDC_VERSION__ >= 201112L
        #include <stdnoreturn.h>
        #elif defined(__GNUC__)
        #define noreturn __attribute__((noreturn))
        #else
        #define noreturn
        #endif

- `static_assert` may be used for statically-checked assertions. This macro may be available even in non-C11 mode,
  so at least the following should used somewhere in the headers:

        #include <assert.h>
        #if !defined(static_assert)
        #define static_assert(x_) ((void)0)
        #endif

  There is a well-known pretty portable trick to achieve almost the same effect as `static_assert`, namely:

        #define static_assert(expr_) ((void)sizeof(char[(expr_) ? 1 : -1]))

- `alignof` and `alignas` constructions allow to determine the alignment of a certain type/object and to
  cause a type/object to have the same alignment as another type/object. These may be used if really necessary,
  if a workaround is provided e. g. through GCC extension attributes. However, it must be noted that in general
  requiring and/or relying upon specific alignment should be confined to special cases.

- `<stdatomic.h>` and `<threads.h>` API should not be used, use platform-provided APIs instead
- so called “bounds-checking” API (actually introduced between C99 and C11) should not be used, as they are generally
  regarded as ill-designed
- Unicode character support (`<uchar.h>`, also introduced between C99 and C11) may be used if you know what are
  doing (most probably you don't need it)
- `_Generic` type dispatching. It's a feature for math library writers and as such should not be used by
  application programmers.
- Anonymous struct/unions. Contrary to a popular belief, they are **not** part of the C99 standard. They are, however,
  part of C++, therefore they have long been supported by various compilers as an extension. Anonymous structs are
  of little practical use, so they should not be used. Anonymous unions may be used, but still the preferred way is
  to give them name.


GCC extensions
--------------

Historically, GCC provided a number of extensions to the C standard, some of which made its way into C99 and
some have been deprecated. Still there are some important extensions, mostly intended to support low-level
programming. The general rule of thumbs is that if the code can be written without an extension, it should not
be used.

- **Inline assembly.** If you think you need to use inline, think again. If you still think you need to use
  it, use it. Always keep in mind that `GCC` inline assembly is very powerful and therefore it's super easy
  to saw one's head off with it. Always wear protective gloves, and consult the doctor immediately in case of
  accidental ingestion.

- **Attributes.** GCC attributes should be used wherever necessary, however the main problem with them is that
  different versions of GCC/clang on different platform support different sets of attributes, sometimes with
  slightly different semantics. To make things worse, there is no definitively list that would show which
  attributes are supported by which compilers. Therefore the preferred way is to use them through conditionally
  defined macro wrappers, like:

        #if __GNUC__ > 4
        #define something __attribute__((some_attr))
        #else
        #define something
        #endif

- **Statement expressions**. They are only meaningful inside complex macros, and complex macros as such should
  be avoided.

- **Computed gotos**. No chance.

- **Nested functions**. They must not be used. It's a very fragile feature, requiring specific constraints on
  run-time, such as the executable stack which is a security threat and so is often disabled. Anyway it won't
  give you the full power of functions-as-first-class-objects found in functional languages. If you need something
  like this, consider using something like `libffi` which provides support for closures.

- **`typeof`**. This is a very useful thing to write type-safe generic macros, so it may be used if appropriate.

- `void *` being treated as `char *` for the purpose of pointer arithmetics. This feature should not be used,
  use properly typed pointers

- **Case ranges.** It is a superficially useful and safe feature, but since it's a syntactic extension that has
  no workaround if not supported, it should not be used.

- Dollar signs in identifiers. No way.

- Thread-local storage with `__thread` qualifiers. It is a much cleaner and type-safe interface to thread-local storage
  than `pthread_*specific()` and C11 provides a complete equivalent of it with its `_Thread_local` keyword, so it
  may be used if appropriate.

- **Various GCC builtins.** They may be used if you know exactly what are doing, and most of them are quite arcane.
  As with attributes, the preferred way is to wrap them into convenience macros.

Compiler warnings
-----------------

Ideally there should be no warnings in the compiler output, and the warning level should be set rather high
(at least, `-Wall` or better yet `-Wall -Wextra`). However, in reality different versions of compilers often
complain about different issues, so it may be rather tricky to silence them all altogether. Still in most
cases warnings convey important information about possible code quality issues, its safety and portability,
and even if they do not, they clobber the compiler output, therefore they must not be in any case plainly ignored.
In any case, the number of warnings per file should be kept to the minimum; if you are seeing pages of warnings,
them you are definitely doing something wrong.

1. The developer **must** make a bona fide effort to produce the code that compiles cleanly in one's own
   development environment.

2. All warnings that cannot be eliminated for all or some target systems **must** be clearly documented at the
   place where they occur.

3. There are several types of warnings that **must not** be tolerated:
   - unused variables/functions/parameters. Those are always trivial to get rid of.
   - pointer type mismatch. Those warnings almost always indicate a serious
     programming flaw, so they should be eliminated.
     *Note* that it *must not* be wiped out by simply adding type casts
     in random places. See more on the subject in the section on data types.
   - missing `return` statements

4. The above does not apply to the sources generated by third-party tools, such as `yacc`, `lex` or `rpcgen`.
   However, if the project build system supports it, it is highly recommended that the spurious warnings should
   be turned off on a per-file basis, e. g. for GNU Make:

            lex.yy.o : CFLAGS += -Wno-unused-parameter

   The sources generated by local tools/scripts should be as warning-free as the manually written ones.

Naming conventions
==================

Choosing names is one of the most important aspects of programming. Good
names clarify the function of a program and reduce the need for other
documentation. Poor names result in ambiguity, confusion and errors.

The ideal name is one that instantly conveys as much information as
possible about the purpose of an entity (variable, function, field,
etc.) it refers to. Try to choose names in such way that they could not
be misinterpreted or confused by other programmers.

Here is the check list for names:

-   Check that the name is consistent. Use the same name to refer to the
    same entity everywhere. For example, if you have passed a pointer to
    some structure descriptor in each function in a module, give the
    same name to the correspondent parameter.

-   Check if the name may be misunderstood out of context. For example,
    if function which performs swapping of odd and even bytes is called
    `swap_buffer()`, this name may be understand incorrectly in other
    context: somebody may think that you have meant swapping buffer to
    the disk.

-   Check if the name may be confused with some other name. For example,
    if two variables with names `str` and `string` in the same procedure
    both refer to strings, it is hard to anyone to remember which is
    which.

-   Check if the name is so generic that it doesn’t convey any
    information.

Words and abbreviations from non-English languages cannot be used to
form identifiers. Use underscore character `_` to separate the words.
Do not fear to use long identifiers. In any case, an identifier *must
not contain* pronouns, interjections, private names, nicknames, or place
names.

Variable, type, field names must be in lower case only. Use upper case
for preprocessor names and enum constants. Do not mix upper and lower
case letters in the same name.

If you have chosen some abbreviation, document it and use the same
abbreviation everywhere in the program.

You must have in mind possible name conflicts when you assign a name to
an entity. A conflict may occur if two global variables or functions are
defined in two places, or if some header files contain declaration of
types, preprocessor variables, structs, etc. with the same name, and
these headers may be included both. The only way how to avoid such
conflicts is to give names in a consistent manner.

You must add module-  or subsystem-specific prefixes to globally visible
names. It is recommended to have prefix not less than 3 character long;
2-character prefix is allowed for some significant wide-used subsystems.
A prefix must be the same for all global names in module or subsystem.
All globally-visible variables and functions must be prefixed. Also, it
is highly recommended to give prefixes to all declarations, type names,
preprocessor variables, struct names in header files which may be
included from external components. It is not required (but allowed), to
prefix local names (names in the header files which may be included only
in particular subsystem and not exported to the outer world, static
variables and functions). Do not prefix field names in structures and
unions.

It is recommended for uniformity to use `object + action +
object/property` style while giving a name to a function. Besides, this
style is convenient when module prefix is used in place of the first
object. For example, `fat_get_cluster(), pkt_send_raw()`.

The only exception for the above rules is if you are implementing
something that has an external given specification or a standard.
Therefore, it is not required to rename `printf` to `libc_printf` if you
are implementing ISO C library!

Conventional comments
=====================

Comments are special remarks intended first of all for human reader, who
needs to understand your work. Comments are very important parts of your
code, it is a way to make your program simple and well-readable. Lack of
comments or inaccurate comments may make life for reader (and may be for
you too!) very complex.

This chapter provides general rules for comment writing.

Comment designators
-------------------

Comments are started with the sequence `/*`. Comments are finished with
the sequence `*/`. It is prohibited to use C++ line comment designator
`//` even if your compiler supports it. Nested comments are not allowed.

Don’t use `/*` and `*/` sequences for temporary removing pieces of your
code. Use preprocessor directives instead.

Language
--------

All comments in your program must be written in English, because
English is the only language that nearly all programmers in all
countries can read.

If it is declared in technical requirement document, that comments must
be written in any other language UTF-8 character set should be used.

Multilingual comments within sources are *highly* not recommended. It is
proposed to use separate translation files for such cases.

Formatting conventions
----------------------

The text of your comment must follow some simple usual conventions.
Statement must be started from capital letter (except case when the
first word is a name of variable, type etc. You must avoid this, but if
you need, write name exactly as it is used). Put one space character
between words in sentences. Couple punctuation mark to the left word and
insert a space character after punctuation mark. Put an empty line
between paragraphs. You must put space character after `/*` and before
`*/`.

Two comment styles may be used: one-line comments and multiline
comments. One line comment looks like this:

    /* This is example of one-line comment */

Multiline comments look like this:

    /*
     * This is example of multiline comment. Such comment layout must be used
     * if your text couldn't be fitted in one 80-character line. Please, note
     * that each line is started with the asterisk character.
     */

Code comments must be indented as appropriate piece of code.

Some specific comment formatting considerations provided in appropriate
chapters of this document.

Comments style
--------------

The purpose of comments is to save time and reduce errors. Comments are
typically used for two purposes. First, people will read the comments to
find out how to use your code. For example, they will read procedure
headers to learn how to call the procedures. Ideally, people should have
to learn as little as possible about your code in order to use it
correctly. Second, people will read the comments to find out how your
code works internally, so they can fix bugs or add new features. More
documentation isn’t necessarily better: reading pages of comments may be
not easier than understanding uncommented code.

It is most important to comment things which affect many different
pieces of program. Thus it is required that every procedure interface,
every structure declaration, and every global variable must be commented
clearly. If you haven’t commented one of these things it will be
necessary to look at all the uses of the thing to understand how it’s
supposed to work.

On the other hand, things with only local impact may not need much
documentation. If the overall purpose of the function has been
explained, and if there isn’t much code in the procedure, and if
variables have meaningful names, it is not required to give any comments
at all. For long functions, comment local variables and logical blocks
of function. Also, comment a tricky situations, non-obvious code which
depends on information to someone reading it for the first time.
Non-Doxygen style (`/* ... */`) should be used for comments in function
body (it saves two symbols and avoids confusion since it is not included
in documentation generated by Doxygen in any case).

Document each thing in exactly one place. If something is documented in
several places, it will be hard to keep the documentation up to date as
the system changes. Try to document each major design decision in
exactly one place.

Don’t just repeat what is already obvious from the code, like this:

    i += 1;   /* Increment i */

Documentation should provide higher-level information about the overall
function of the code, helping readers to understand what a complex
collection of statements really means.

It is extremely important to write comments as you write the code. Don’t
delay documentation writing until you finish to implement and change
your code. You will never write good comments in such case, because you
will never stop coding: there is always more code you have to write. If
you accumulate more undocumented code, it will be harder to you to find
energy and time to comment it. So, you just write more undocumented
code. Finally, you may forget some important things which must be
documented.

If you write comments as you go, it won’t add much to your coding time
and you won’t have to worry about doing it later. Therefore, it is
required to write comments as you write the code.

File layout
===========

This chapter describes general rules about C source and headers file
layout.

Order of file sections
----------------------

Every file containing C source code must be started from standard file
header. After the header the following sections should be included in
the specified recommended order:

-   General file documentation. It is a C comment consisting of a
    complete description of the overall module purpose and function.

-   Includes. The include section (if exists) consist of one or more C
    preprocessor `#include` directives. This section groups all header
    files included in the module in one place. In most cases, system
    include files, such as `stdio.h`, should be included first.
    Subsystem interface include files (see below) usually must be
    included before subsystem headers. Header files that declare
    functions or external variables should be included in the file that
    defines the function or variable.

-   Defines. The defines section (if it exists) consists of one or more
    C preprocessor `#define` directives. This section (if it exists)
    groups all definitions made in module in one place.

-   Types. This section (if it exists) contains all struct, typedef,
    enum definitions and groups it together.

-   Forwards. The forward declarations section (if it exists) consists
    of one or more ISO C function prototypes. This section groups all
    such declarations together.

-   Globals. This section (if it exists) consists of all
    external-visible variables definitions and groups it together.

-   Locals. This section consists of all variables visible only inside
    this module (static variables) and groups it together.

-   Functions. The functions section (if it exists) consists of one or
    more C function definitions. This section groups all such
    declarations together. In this section similar functions (functions
    on a similar level of abstraction) should be placed together.

If you see that it is better to repeat some of these sections two or
more times to group similar things together, you may do it, saving
provided order in each such group. However, all functions should be
implemented after all preceding definitions anyway. Nevertheless,
remember that it means that your software is likely to have a poor
design. It is recommended to split source or header file to many smaller
ones in this case.

Human-written file headers
--------------------------

Each `.c` or `.h` files written by human, must have a formal header.
This header starts at the first line of source file. A header has the
following format:

    /* SPDX-License-Identifier: <identifier> */
    /* <copyright notice> */
    /* <license terms (optional)> */
    /** @file
     * @brief <subsystem description>
     *
     * <module description>
     */

Subsystem description is a short (one-line preferred) description of
subsystem to which this file belongs. This line must be same for all
files of this subsystem.

Module description is a short description of a source file. It should
start with an upper-case letter, and end with a dot.

Copyright notice must provide information about copyright holder of this
work. This line must consist of the word `Copyright`, copyright sign
`(C)`, the year when the file is created, and the name of the organisation
which holds the rights. Multiple `Copyright` statements are allowed and
required if the source contains portions copyrighted by different entities.

For the code owned by OKTET Labs, the copyright notice must read as:

    Copyright (C) <year> OKTET Labs Ltd. All rights reserved.

Previous versions of the Guidelines mandated the use of the `@author`
keyword to indicate actual code authors/contributors. This is now
strongly **discouraged**, since this information is almost impossible
to keep up to date in the sources, but it can easily be obtained from
a version control system.

The optional license term notice may be added to provide
information about licensing terms for this source file, about
distribution permissions or restrictions, or to refer to a particular
license text. However, for open-source products a non-Doxygen comment
shall be provided at the top of file, bearing an accurate
`SPDX-License-Identifier`.

Example:

    /* SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0-or-later */
    /* Copyright (C) 2022 OKTET Labs Ltd. All rights reserved. */
    /** @file
     * @brief ncr875 controller device driver.
     *
     * Chip-specific primitive implementation.
     */

Generated file headers
----------------------

Some of source files fed to compiler may be generated by other programs
or scripts. Such programs or scripts must put special header at the
beginning of such files:

    /*
     * This file is automatically generated by program <program>.
     * DO NOT EDIT IT!!!
     *
     * File generated at <date> <time>
     */

Format YYYY-MM-DD should be used for date specification.

Header (`.h`) files
---------------------

Header files are started with the same header as `.c` files. Header
files must include C variable and function declarations, common type
definitions, preprocessor definitions, definitions of inline functions
which may be used in more than one C module. Each module which requires
definitions from headers must include appropriate header using
preprocessor directive `#include`. If some header file uses definitions
or declarations from another header file, it is recommended to include
that header file to the first one. (Usually, header file contains some
interface definition, and it is poor if user of this interface must know
about internal things needed for this interface declaration.)

There are two kinds of header files: which define interface to subsystem
and which define inter-module interfaces inside specific subsystem. Try
not to mix these two kinds of header files. Do not include internal
definitions and declarations to the interface headers.

Header file must be started with the same header as C source code file.
The body of header file must be organised in the following way:

    #ifndef __<subsystem_prefix>_<filename>_H__
    #define __<subsystem_prefix>_<filename>_H__

    #include <nesting_header.h>
    ...

    #ifdef __cplusplus
    extern "C" {
    #endif

    ...

    #ifdef __cplusplus
    }
    #endif
    #endif /* __<subsystem_prefix>_<filename>_H__ */

In this fragment `<subsystem_prefix>` must be substituted with
capitalised subsystem abbreviation, `<filename>` must be substituted
with capitalised form of header file name. If the filename already
contains the subsystem prefix there is no need to add another one.

Conditionals `#ifdef __cplusplus` used to make possible usage of
appropriate header in C++ program. These preprocessor conditionals may
be omitted in internal headers, but are mandatory for interface headers.
It is important to including nesting headers before `#ifdef __cplusplus`
block in order not to affect symbols declared there.

Declarations in headers
-----------------------

All declarations that are not definitions in headers must have an explicit
`extern` linkage. That is, all functions that are not declared `static inline`
and all variables in headers must have an `extern` keyword. Global declarations
without an explicit linkage specifier and no initialiser or function body are
called "tentative definitions", that is, they may be treated by the linker as
definitions or as forward declarations depending on the context and that may
lead to undefined behaviour of the linker (see ISO C standard, section 6.9
for details).


Function Definition Formatting
==============================

Function header
---------------

It is required to put formal function header before each function
definition. Function header have the following format:

    /**
     * <function description>
     *
     * @param <param1>      <param1 description>
     * @param <param2>      <param2 description>
     * ...
     *
     * @return <return value description>
     *
     * @retval <retval1>    <retval1 specification>
     * @retval <retval2>    <retval2 specification>
     * ...
     *
     * @se <side effects description>
     *
     * @sa <closely related functions and documentation references>
     *
     * @alg <algorithm description>
     *
     * @bug <bug description>
     *
     * @todo <todo description>
     */

Not all parts must be presented in each function header.

The only always required part is `<function description>`. It should
start with an upper-case letter and end with a dot. It is
recommended to use common style of the form ’Copy bytes’ (which is
opposite to ’Copies bytes’) for documentation similarity. If the
function complies with some prototype, it should be stated in
description.

At the same time it is *mandatory* to describe all function parameters
and returned value(s). If a function does not return a value,
`@return` part may be omitted, or \<return value specification\> may
be `N/A` (not applicable).

All parameter descriptions shall be either sentences or nominal phrases,
i.e. they shall either start with an upper case letter and end with a dot
or start with a lower-case letter and have no dot at the end.
The preferred form for a parameter description is a nominal phrase, since
a parameter is an object. If a parameter description consists of
several sentences, they all must be formatted as sentences. However,
it is recommended to keep parameter descriptions short and move additional
details to `@note` sections in the function description.

The description of a return value after `@return` tag must have the same
form as parameter descriptions (i.e. either a sentence or a nominal phrase).

If a value directly returned by a function lies within a limited set of
constants, then each constant should be described using `@retval` tag.
The description of a specific returned value after `@retval` tag must be
a sentence, starting with an upper-case letter and ending with a dot.

If a parameter is used to deliver values out from a function, it is
allowed to add `[in,out]` or `[out]` (depending on whether the parameter
is used or not as input at the same time accordingly) hint just after
`@param` without any space. If such hints are used, input parameters
have to be marked using `[in]`. Thus, in/out hints should be used for
either all or none parameters.

`@se` (side effects) part must be presented only when a function has
non-obvious side effects. For example, if this function essentially
modifies common data structures, and it is not clear from its name, or a
function prints something to standard output, changes state of some
hardware, and so on.

Use optional `@sa` (see also) part to give references to closely
related functions and documentation blocks.

Optional `@bug` and `@todo` sections may be used to identify found
bugs or things that need to be done accordingly.

`@alg` (algorithm) part must be provided only when it is not enough to
define *what* function does; it is necessary to explain *how* this
achieved.

### Indentation inside function header

The function description as well as any of the sections beginning tags
must be started from the 3rd column position (beginning with 0) just
after the `' * '` sequence of characters.

Use exactly one `SPACE` character between any of section beginning
tags and start of section body, if the body begins on the same line with
a tag.

\<paramX description\>, \<retvalX specification\>, as well as any line
(except first) of multiline section must be indented by multiples of 8
spaces. This simplifies text formatting with TAB key. The whole indented
description must form a single column. In other words, it is not allowed
to have a line indented by 8 characters, and other one indented by 16.

Function Formatting
-------------------

All functions must be defined in ISO C format. Function definition must
look like this:

    /**
     * Create object instance of class 'objclass' which designates to be
     * referred as a null object of this class. If 'name' is given
     * (not equal to NULL), register object instance with given name.
     *
     * @param  objclass     Class object identifier.
     * @param  name         Null object name, or NULL.
     *
     * @return
     *      Object identifier for null object of class 'objclass', or
     *      OBJID_NULL, if error occurred.
     */
    static objid
    object_create_null(objid objclass, char *name)
    {
        objid obj;
        
        obj = class_instantiate(objclass);
        if (obj == OBJID_NULL)
        {
            return OBJID_NULL;
        }
        if (name != NULL)
        {
            int rc;
            
            rc = object_register_with_name(obj, name);
            if (rc != OBJ_SUCCESSFUL)
            {
                object_delete_instance(obj);
                return OBJID_NULL;
            }
        }
        return obj;
    }

Please, pay your attention to the following topics:

-   Open and close curly brackets must be placed at the column zero.

-   Function name is started at column zero.

Such formatting will simplify use of some tools. For example, `grep`
command can be used to find location of a specific function definition:

    $ grep ^object_create_null *

If argument list can not fit in one line, this line can be split in the
following way:

    static objid
    datafile_encode(int in_file_desc, int out_file_desc, char *encoding_key,
                    int encoding_key_len, int control)
    {
        ...
    }

Considerations
--------------

It is *highly not recommended* to pass or return structures to or from
functions. Pass pointers instead and make a copy inside the function if
it is really necessary.

If the function has no parameters, `void` must be used as the only item
in the parameters list.

It is required to define a function with `static` specifier if the
function must be visible only inside a current module (file).

Function return type must be declared. Do not default it to `int`; if a
function does not return a value then it must be given return type
`void`.

Function size
-------------

It is not possible to give hard limits for function code size. In any
case, remember that it is better if function is pretty simple, pretty
short and pretty clear. If it is possible, try to limit function size by
25-27 lines of code - such functions usually may fit on one terminal
screen; this simplifies understanding what function does. If it is not
possible, size up to 70-140 lines is good, and up to 400-500 is
acceptable. If your function is overgrown, try to redesign it to isolate
logically separable parts in different functions.

Parameters and local variables conventions
------------------------------------------

Function parameters may be divided into three categories.

-   In parameters only pass information into the function (either
    directly or by pointing to information that the function read).

-   Out parameters point to things in the caller’s memory that the
    procedure modifies.

-   In-out parameters do both.

Parameters should normally appear in the order {in, in-out, out}.

Parameters which have source/destination semantics must always appear in
the order {destination, source}.

If there is a group of functions, all of which operate on structures of
a particular type (hash table, device descriptor structure, etc),
parameter which points to this structure should be the first argument of
each function. All such parameters must have the same name.

Do not use `auto` memory class specifier with local variables. If you
think that some (3-4 maximum) variables are used in a critical part of
code or are frequently used, you may give `register` memory class
specifier.

Avoid local declarations that override declarations at higher levels. In
particular, local variables must not be redeclared in nested blocks.

Local variables naming conventions
----------------------------------

It is recommended to give short but clear names to local variables. Here
are some recommended names for local variables. All these names may be
used with possible digit suffixes.

Names `i`, `j`, `k` must be used as names for loop variables.

Names `n`, `m` must be used as a names for variables which contain a
number of some entities. Variable name `l` (ell) may be used for length
of something.

Names `s` or `str` (only one of them in one function!) may be used as a
pointer to character strings.

Names `s` or `sock` may be used for a socket file descriptors.

Name `fd` may be used to refer to a file descriptor variable.

Name `f` may be used for a file descriptor or `FILE` variable associated
with file (*not* socket or device).

Name `fn` may be used for a string containing the file name.

Names `p`, `q` must be used as a pointer to some data element
(structures, elements of array, etc). It is acceptable to use `p` and
`q` identifiers as pointers to character arrays too.

Names `t`, `tmp` must be used as temporary variables.

Name `src` may be used as a pointer to source of string, buffer,
structure, etc. Name `dst` may be used as a pointer to destination.

Names `in` and `out` must be used for pointers or indexes in input and
output data.

Name `c` may be used as a temporary variable for character.

Name `que` may be associated with some kind of queue.

Names `x`, `y`, and `z` may be associated with coordinates.

Names `w` and `h` may be associated with width and height of something.

Name `a` may be used for a some kind of addresses. Names `pa` and `va`
may be used for physical and virtual addresses accordingly.

Name `conn` may be used for a file descriptor or other entity
representing connection.

*Example:*

        int i;
        
        ...
        
        p = &queue_pool[0];
        n = sizeof(queue_pool);
        if (n > max_queue_size)
        {
            n = max_queue_size;
        }
        for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            p->data = NULL;
            p->id = i;
            p->next = p + 1;
            p++;
        }

It is not allowed to have more than three variables with the same name
and different suffixes.

Comments for local variables are necessary only when it is really
necessary. You must comment non-obvious variables in long functions
only. It is not necessary to comment variables which are used in clear
way, for example loop counters, etc.

Inline functions
----------------

Contrary to a popular belief, `inline` keyword has (almost) nothing
to do with optimizations for modern compilers: a function with an `inline`
specifier is not necessarily inlined and a function without it may well
be inlined.

Therefore, `inline` keyword is essentially a no-op for static functions
declared in a C source. Moreover, the compiler does not have access to
the body of a function defined in another compilation unit, so an `inline`
for a public function is also essentially a no-op (`extern inline` functions
are defined by the C standard, but it's an obscure feature which tends to be
misimplemented by compilers). Thus the only sensible context for `inline`
is for functions _defined_ (not just declared) in C headers, together with
`static` storage class specifier. The use of `static` alone in a header would
usually result in a compiler warning about a static function being not used.

Inline functions are safer than macros, but still they should not be abused:
- putting a function definition in a header reveals unnecessary implementation
  details
- it makes the header lengthy and harder to skim through

Variadic functions are never inlined (at least GCC states so), so they should
not be made inline.

An inline function should not have local `static` variables, since such
variables would be cloned in each module where the function is used.

Types definitions formatting
============================

`struct` declaration
--------------------

### `struct` comments

You must insert comment immediately before structure declaration which
describes purpose of this structure, usage conventions and give other
necessary information.

You must give a detailed comment for each field of declared structure.

Usually understanding of data structures used in program is a key to
understanding of a whole system. Please, write accurate and detailed
comments for structure declarations.

Descriptions for structure fields may be formatted either as normal
pre-object Doxygen comments or as post-object ones (that is,
starting with `/**<`). In the latter case they should be placed on the
same line as the field itself. Post-object descriptions inside
a structure shall be aligned. Pre-object descriptions shall be indented
at the same level as the field and otherwise follow the rules for
other types of Doxygen comments.

Multi-line post-object comments are strongly **discouraged**, though
tolerated in the old code. It's better not to mix pre- and post-object
comments within the same structure.

Post-object member descriptions may be either sentences or nominal phrases,
i.e. either starting with an upper case and ending with a dot or starting
with a lower case and ending with no dot. The second form is preferable.

### `struct` formatting

The `struct` declaration must look like this
(post-object style for field descriptions):

    /** Node of the double-linked list. */
    struct list_node {
        struct list_node  *next;    /**< next node in double-linked list */
        struct list_node  *prev;    /**< previous node in double-linked list */
        int                size;    /**< information field size */
        char               node[];  /**< information field designator */
    };

Alternatively it may look like this
(pre-object style for field descriptions):

    /** Node of the double-linked list. */
    struct list_node {
        /** Next node in double-linked list. */
        struct list_node *next;
        /** Previous node in double-linked list. */
        struct list_node *prev;

        /** Information field size. */
        int size;
        /** Information field designator. */
        char node[];
    };

Blank lines may be inserted between struct members to improve
readability or to separate logical groups of fields.
Doxygen member groups may also be used for that purpose:

    /** Node of the double-linked list. */
    struct list_node {
        /** @name Chain pointers. */
        /**@{*/
        /** Next node in double-linked list. */
        struct list_node *next;
        /** Previous node in double-linked list. */
        struct list_node *prev;
        /**@}*/

        /** @name Payload. */
        /**@{*/
        /** Information field size. */
        int size;
        /** Information field designator. */
        char node[];
        /**@}*/
    };

If `struct` declaration is used in a variable declaration or `typedef`
declaration, `typedef` or variable specifiers must be placed before
`struct` keyword on the same line, and identifier must be placed after
close bracket on the same line:

    /** NCR875 SCSI host adapter user-settable hardware parameters. */
    typedef struct ncr875_hw_regs {
        /** Differential SCSI bus enable. */
        int diff_scsi;
        /** Tolerant enable. */
        int tolerant;
        /** Slow cable mode (Extra clock cycle of Data Setup). */
        int slow_cable;

        /**
         * Maximum number of transfers performed per PCI bus
         * ownership, legal values is 2,4,8,16,32,64,128.
         */
        int burst_len;
    } ncr875_hw_regs;

Note the formatting of a multi-line comment in the previous example.

In `typedef` declaration, it is recommended to give the same name to
`struct` name in `struct` namespace and to `typedef` name.

The member names should be aligned if they are followed by post-object comments
which are themselves aligned. Otherwise they need not be aligned, just
as variable names. If a field has a pointer type then `*`s must adjoin
to the field name, but they must be placed to the left of the alignment
column, as in the first example above.

It is *highly not recommended* to join struct and variable declaration.
Declare types and variables separately.

In some cases nested `struct/union` declarations are acceptable, but it
is not recommended.

### Bit fields

You may use bit fields to save memory if you know how much bits is
sufficient to store some specific value. But in any case you should not
make any assumptions about order in which these bit fields are
allocated, because it may be compiler-specific. Therefore, it is
prohibited to declare, for example, hardware register layout as a
structure with bit fields, or represent structure of binary file in such
way, or define structure of data which will be sent over network.

`union` declaration
-------------------

All conventions provided for struct formatting apply to `union`
declarations.

`enum` declaration
------------------

### `enum` formatting conventions

Basically, the same rules apply here as for struct/union definitions.

The `enum` declaration must look like this:

```
/** LED status constants. */
enum led_status {
    LED_STATUS_OFF = 0,   /**< LED is off */
    LED_STATUS_ON = 1,    /**< LED is off */
    LED_STATUS_FAIL = 2,  /**< LED is non-functional */
    LED_STATUS_MAINT = 4, /**< LED is now in maintenance mode */
};
```

Or alternatively with post-object comments, if you need multi-line descriptions:

```
/** LED status constants. */
enum led_status {
    /** LED is off. */
    LED_STATUS_OFF = 0,
    /** LED is off. */
    LED_STATUS_ON = 1,
    /** LED is non-functional. */
    LED_STATUS_FAIL = 2,

    /**
     * LED is now in maintenance mode;
     * operations are limited.
     */
    LED_STATUS_MAINT = 4,
};
```

However it is recommended to keep the enum member descriptions short,
use the first variant and provide extra details in the description of `enum`
itself.

Each `enum` member must be on a separate line.

### `enum` member conventions

`enum` member names must be prefixed with some abbreviation common for all
members. `enum` member names must be upper-case.

It is necessary to give a value for each member, if this value is
specified externally (in manual, data sheet, technical specification,
etc). Otherwise it is recommended not to assign values, or assign a
value to the first element only. Aligning enum assignments on a `=`
character is not needed, though tolerated in the old code.

Type qualifiers
---------------

Don’t forget to give type qualifiers (`const` and `volatile`) when it is
necessary, especially `volatile` specifier.

Absence of `volatile` specifier in place where it is required is a
serious subtle error. Save your time and think every time when
`volatile` specifier may be significant. Do not give `volatile`
specifier to types, fields, variables which do not require it, because
it may lead to misunderstanding and make your code worse.

It’s *highly* recommended to give `const` specifier when it is
applicable, because it may make compiler output better and help you to
avoid some errors.

Variable declaration formatting
===============================

Each variable declaration must be on a separate line.
Global-space variables definitions must start at column 0. Local
variable definitions must start at the block indent level, same as for the
statements in this block. `*` specifiers must adjoin to variable names
(or function names in forward declarations), not to their types:

    /* Correct: */
    int *iptr;
    char **strptr;
    const char * const *cstrptr;
    int *(*funptr)(int *arg);
    extern int *function(int arg);

    /* Incorrect: */
    int* iptr;
    char** strptr;
    const char* const* cstrptr;
    int* (*funptr)(int* arg);
    extern int* function(int arg);

In the previous versions of the Guide it was required that the names and
descriptions of variables be aligned on the same column for each logical block.
This is a very unfortunate requirement, because when a change
breaks the alignment, additional changes in unrelated lines are needed
to restore it, thus clobbering the commit and confusing `git blame`.
Therefore such block alignment is now strongly **discouraged**, however
it is tolerated in the legacy code.

As a rule of thumb, local variables should not have any descriptions at all,
because Doxygen can't handle them anyway and their purpose should be evident
from their names and the context. If they still need some comments, those
must be plain C comments, not the Doxygen ones.

Global variables shall be documented in the same way as other global objects.
However, please keep in mind that a group of tightly-coupled global variables
is usually a very bad coding practice. In most cases the preferred way is to
define a structure and use a single variable of that structure type.

So, the following sample from the previous version is invalid:

```
/* Wrong, old code: */
/* Phase correction algorithm variables */
static fixed16  phase_error; /**< Currently estimated phase error */
static int      phcorr_num;  /**< Number of processed samples */
static fixed16 *sample;      /**< Next sample pointer */

static uint32     input_bit_number;   /**< Number of bits received from
                                           external interface */
```

If a block of tightly coupled variables need a common description, then
Doxygen member groups may be used:

```
/**
 * @name Phase correction algorithm variables.
 *
 * Here may come some more details on the algorithm and the role
 * of individual variables.
 * @{
 */
static fixed16 phase_error;
static int phcorr_num;
static fixed16 *sample;
/**@}*/
```

If individual variables still need descriptions, use normal
Doxygen pre-object description:

```
/** Currently estimated phase error. */
static fixed16 phase_error;
/** Number of processed samples. */
static int phcorr_num;
/** Next sample pointer. */
static fixed16 *sample;

/** Number of bits received from external interface. */
static uint32 input_bit_number;
```

But in most cases the preferred way would be something like:

```
/** Phase correction algorithm state. */
typedef struct phase_correction_state {
    /** Currently estimated phase error. */
    fixed16 phase_error;
    /** Number of processed samples. */
    int phcorr_num;
    /** Next sample pointer. */
    fixed16 *sample;
} phase_correction_state;

/** Current phase correction state. */
static phase_correction_state phase_state;

/** Number of bits received from external interface. */
static uint32 input_bit_number;
```

Logical groups of tightly coupled variables shall be
separated by a blank line, as in examples above.

Variable declarations should not normally be mixed with the code. That is,
variables should always be declared on a file level or at the very beginning of
a block, not inside blocks. Unlike in C++, in plain C mixing declarations and
code gives no benefits and is usually a sign that a function should be split.

For example:

```
/* Wrong */
int
some_function(int arg)
{
    int var1;

    if (arg > 0)
        var1 = another_function(arg);
    else
        var1 = DEFAULT_VALUE;
    int var2 = another_function(var1);
    /* more code to follow */
}

/* Ok */
int
some_function(int arg)
{
    int var1;
    int var2;

    if (arg > 0)
        var1 = another_function(arg);
    else
        var1 = DEFAULT_VALUE;
    var2 = another_function(var1);
    /* more code to follow */
}

/* Ok as well, var2 is defined at the beginning of an inner scope */
int
some_function(int arg)
{
    int var1;
    int var2;

    if (arg > 0)
    {
        int var2;

        var1 = another_function(arg);
        var2 = another_function(var1);
        /* more code to follow */
    }
}
```

The code before declarations may be tolerated in case of debug log macros
and the like, which must be executed before anything else:

```
int
some_function(int arg)
{
    DEBUG_ENTRY(arg);
    int var1 = another_function(arg);
    int var2 = another_function(var1);

    /* more code */
}
```

Literals and constants
======================

Try not to use numeric constant values in code (except simple cases,
like constants 0, 1, -1 and in some rare situations when direct constant
usage may be more clear than identifier usage - for example bit masks
like 0xff).

When multiline string constant is used, it is recommended to insert
`\n` character explicitly and close quote at each line.

*Examples:*

    /* Right: */
    void
    usage_information_print(void)
    {
        printf("check -- check C source code to the C Source Code Style "
               "conformance\n"
               "Usage:\n"
               "    check <filename>\n");
    }

    /* Wrong: */
    void
    usage_information_print(void)
    {
        printf("
    check -- check C source code to the C Source Code Style conformance
    Usage:
        check <filename>\n");
    }

If constant length suffix is used, the capital suffix letter must be
used (use `0L`, not `0l`). Similarly, for floating point constants, use
capital exponent letter `E` (use `1.25E+35`, not `1.25e+35`).

In hexadecimal constants, lower-case letters must be used (use
`0xdeadbeef`, not `0xDEADBEEF`).

C Expressions
=============

Unary operators `&`, `*`, `+`, `-`, `~`, `!`, `++`, `--`
must be coupled with operands to which such operators are applied.

Binary operators `*`, `/`, `%`, `+`, `-`, `>>`, `<<`,
`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`, `&`, `^`, `|`,
`&&`, `||`, `=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, `+=`, `-=`, `<<=`,
`>>=`, `&=`, `^=`, `|=` must be separated by one space at left
and right.

Operators `.` and `->` must be coupled with both operands.

Operator `,` (comma) must be coupled to its left operand and separated
by one space character from the right operand.

Operator `[]` must be coupled to the left and inner operands.

Syntactic components of conditional operator `a ? b : c` must be
separated by one space character. It is recommended to enclose
conditional operator into the parenthesis.

Grouping parenthesis must be coupled with the contents inside brackets.

In function call no delimiters must be added between function name or
function expression and left round bracket. Also, no delimiters must be
inserted between open round bracket and first operand and between close
round bracket and between last operand.

`sizeof` operator must use syntax similar to function call.

Round brackets of type cast operator must be coupled with type specifier
and with operand.

It is allowed to use embedded assignment statement if it make code
simpler and better readable. Don’t use embedded assignment in artificial
places. For example,

        x = x1 + w;
        pos = ofs + x;

should not be replaced by

        pos = ofs + (x = x1 + w);

*More examples:*

        p = p->next;  /* Correct */
        n = - n;      /* Incorrect */
        ++ b;         /* Incorrect */
        b++;          /* Correct */
        printf("Internal error: %d\\n", (class << 8) | errno);
        scsi_freq = (freq_multiplier ? freq * 2 : freq);
        list = hash_tab[hash_func(key) % hash_mod];
        memcpy(dest, src, n);

It is recommended to insert additional unnecessary parenthesis to
expression to make it more readable. It is recommended to assume only
that unary operators have higher priority than binary and that
multiplication operators has higher priority that addition.

It is allowed to insert additional spaces between binary operators, if
it is improve readability. For example, if you have a group of
statements which fill fields of structure, code with aligned assignment
operators seems better. Sometimes, additional spaces may help to show
structure of complex expressions.

Do not test non-boolean expression as you test a boolean. For example,
where `x` is integer, use `if (x == 0)` instead `if (!x)`.

When you split expression into multiple lines, break line after
operator. Line up continuation lines with the part of the preceding line
they continue.

C Statements Formatting
=======================

`if` statement
--------------

`if` statement must look like this:

        if (p != NULL)
        {
            if (p->flag & FEL_INACTIVE)
                continue;
            else
                p = p->next;
        }

It is recommended to enclose `if` branches into curly braces in each
case, except it is a small simple statement. Particularly, it is
recommended to enclose `if` branches when it is nested to other `if` or
when this branch contains nested `if` statements. Also, it is
recommended to enclose branch in curly braces if the other branch is
enclosed.

`if - else if - else if...` statements must be formatted like this:

        if (strcmp(reply, "yes") == 0)
        {
            ...
        }
        else if (strcmp(reply, "no") == 0)
        {
            ...
        }
        else
        {
            ...
        }

`for` statement
---------------

`for` statement may look like this:

        for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
            x += buf[i];

Alternative form of `for` statement applied when components of `for` can
not fit into the one 80-character line.

        for (p = list->head, i = 0;
             p && !(element_is_invalid(p));
             p = list_element_next(p), i++)
        {
            list_element_register(p);
        }

It is recommended to enclose `for` body in curly braces in every case
except when `for` components fit in one line and `for` body is
sufficiently simple (something like `n += j;`, not a compound
statement).

`while` statement
-----------------

`while` statement must look like this:

        while (p != NULL)
        {
            interp_evaluate_node(p);
            p = p->next;
        }

It is recommended to enclose `while` body in curly braces in every case
except when `while` condition fits in one line and `while` body is
sufficiently simple (something like `n += j;`, not a compound
statement).

`do` statement
--------------

`do` statement must look like this:

        do {
            entry_process(&n, entry);
        } while (n > 0);

`switch` statement
------------------

`switch` statement must look like this:

        switch (action)
        {
            case ACTION_NOP:
            case ACTION_NEXT:
                break;

            case ACTION_COPY:
                *new_type = *type;
                state = STATE_COPIED;
                break;

            case ACTION_MOVE:
                *new_type = *type;
                type = NULL;
                break;

            case ACTION_CLONE:
            {
                int i;
                
                for (i = 0; i < type_num; i++)
                {
                    clone_type[i] = *type;
                }
                state = STATE_CLONED;
                break;
            }

            default:
                assert(0);
        }

`switch` branches must be separated by empty lines. Each `case` label
must be placed on a separate line. You must enclose statements in curly
braces only if some local variables must be declared in block.

It is recommended to finish each `switch` branch with `break` statement.
If you really want to continue execution in the next `switch` branch,
insert comment `/*@fallthrough@*/` before empty line which separates two
branches (it is used by Splint to annotate suspicious places in code).

The `default` case, if used, should be last and does not require a
`break` if it is last. To make your code safer, it is recommended to add
`default` branch always.

`goto` statement
----------------

It is *highly not recommended* to use `goto` statement in your program.
In most cases it means that you code has poor design. Try to use
“structural goto” statements, like `break`, `continue`, `return`. In
some rare cases `goto` usage may be acceptable. For example, if function
performs multiple resource allocations, and fail occurs, all allocated
resources must be released. If fail condition may occur in many places,
it is possible to use `goto` statement to jump to the resource
deallocation fragment at the end of the function. If it is possible to
avoid such `goto` usage (for example, if resource deallocation function
exists and may be used) `goto` must not be used.

Preprocessor usage
==================

Preprocessor directives formatting
----------------------------------

Preprocessor directives must be started at column zero. It is not
allowed to have spaces between `#` sign and directive name.

`#include` usage
----------------

Use `<...>` with file name in `#include` to include ISO C headers or
header files provided by the target operating system.

Use quotes `"..."` with file name to include other headers.

`#define` constant definitions
------------------------------

It is alternative to `enum` method to give symbolic names to constants.
In some cases it is more convenient than `enum`, but `enum` is a
preferred method for constant definitions (at least, because many
debuggers couldn’t use preprocessing information).

`#define` must be used for a constant definition when the constant is
used in preprocessor expressions. Also, for example, hardware register
definitions may be included in the assembler source, so it is better to
use `#define` to define them.

Macros
------

It is required to surround all macro parameters with parenthesis,
because complex expressions can be used as macro parameters, and
operator-precedence problems can arise. Body of function-like macros
must be surrounded with parenthesis too.

Lets consider the next code fragment:

    #define DEBUG(s_) \
        if (debug)                      \
        {                               \
            printf("debug: %s\n", s_);  \
        }
        
        ...
        
        if (p == NULL)
            DEBUG("p is NULL");
        else
            ...

In this example the attempt to compile will result in syntax error, and
curly braces around the whole macro body do not help in this case
either. If you forget to put the semicolon after the macro call the else
branch of `if (p == NULL)` statement will become associated with the
`if` statement in `DEBUG` macro. To avoid this, all statement-like
macros must be surrounded by `do { ... } while (0)` statement:

    #define DEBUG(s_) \
        do {                               \
            if (debug)                     \
            {                              \
                printf("debug: %s\n", s_); \
            }                              \
        } while (0)

Also, lets consider the following example:

    #define INC(i_) \
        do {                                                 \
            printf("Loop counter new value is %d\n", ++i_);  \
        } while (0)

        ...

        for (i = 0; i < 5; ({INC(i);}))
        {
            ...
        }

The example states how macros surrounded by `do { ... } while (0)`
statement may be used in `for()` statement components. The macro call is
surrounded by curly and, then, round brackets.

It is recommended to hold macros on one line if it is possible. If no,
format macros as it is shown in a bad example above. Line up all
continuation backslashes on right side of macro body. Check that
backslash is the last character in this string. Do not put any code in
first line where macros name and parameters are given. Follow to the
indentation rules in body of macros.

Function-like macros must be commented like functions. Types of
parameters should be stated in macro description.

It’s recommended to use inline functions instead of function-like
macros, if it is applicable. Compiler can help to avoid some errors and
its output in the case of compilation errors more friendly, if inline
function is used.

Macro names must be upper case. However, it is allowed to have lower-case
names for function-like macros if these macros do not cause any macro adverse
effects and especially if they try to mimic some standard function/macro:

    /* Ok */
    #define my_assert(expr_) \
        do {                                          \
            if (!(expr_))                             \
            {                                         \
                ERROR("Assertion %s failed", #expr_); \
                abort();                              \
            }                                         \
        } while (0)

    /* Not ok, since the arguments have to be side-effect free */
    #define min(x_, y_) ((x_) < (y_) ? (x_) : (y_))

Scoped macros
-------------

C does not have true local macros. However, they can be simulated by
using `#undef`. Thus, if a macro is used solely inside a block, e.g.
inside a function body, it must be declared inside the block at its
beginning and undefined at the end. The same applies to macros that
are used just in a part of the source file: they must be defined
close to their first usage and then undefined. The directives must
still start at the first column, even inside blocks:


```
int
function(int arg)
{
#define CHECK_RC(expr_) \
    do {                   \
        int rc_ = (expr_); \
                           \
        if ((rc_) != 0)    \
            return (rc_);  \
    } while (0)
    /* the code */
#undef CHECK_RC
}
```

Macro argument names
--------------------

Macro argument names shall end with an underscore to minimise possible
name clashes. The same applies to local variables defined inside a macro
body. See macro examples in the previous sections. Macro arguments shall
be in lower case just as function parameter names.

Historically, there is a great inconsistency in our code base regarding
the form of macro argument names. At least the following variants have
been observed in the wild:
- no underscores: `#define MACRO(arg)`
- leading underscore `#define MACRO(_arg)`
- trailing underscore `#define MACRO(arg_)`
- enclosing underscores `#define MACRO(_arg_)`

The second variant is the most common, however, it was not chosen because
it technically violates the ISO C standard that reserve all identifiers
starting with underscore and proclaim using them in an application undefined
behaviour.


Conditional compilation
-----------------------

Conditional compilation is useful for making your code portable by
handling different machines and OS behaviour. Also, it is useful for
debugging and for setting certain options at compile time. Be careful:
various controls may easily combine in unforeseen ways. Check for error
condition combination or absence or incorrect value of some preprocessor
variables. In last case, use preprocessor directive `#error` to handle
such situations.

It is recommended to maintain syntactic correctness in false branches.

Try to put `#if`/`#ifdef` directives in header files instead C source
file. Use `#if`/`#ifdef` to define macros that can be used uniformly in
the code. For instance, a header file for checking memory allocation
might look like:

    #ifdef DEBUG
        extern void *mm_malloc(size_t bytes);
    #define MALLOC(size_) (mm_malloc(size_))
    #else
        extern void *malloc(size_t bytes);
    #define MALLOC(size_) (malloc(size_))
    #endif

It is recommended to use indentation rules for preprocessor conditions
too.

Conditional compilation should generally be on a feature-by-feature
basis. Although, one of usage of conditional preprocessor directives is
to handle differences between different machines or operating systems.
OS type, CPU kind, board, implementation etc. dependencies via
conditional compilation should be avoided in most cases. Use name of the
feature or property instead of name of bearing entity.

You may exclude fragment of your code using `#if 0` directive.

Safe programming
================

It is *highly* recommended to use `snprintf()` instead of `sprintf()`.
If `sprintf()` is still used, it has to be guaranteed and explained in
comment just before the usage why the buffer is sufficient.

Return code of the non-void function calls should be checked. The check
may be skipped when following conditions are true:

-   Recovery/cleanup is not possible in the case of error.

-   Error is logged inside the function or error is expected in some
    scenarios or error definitely has no side effects.

It’s not recommended to use (void)\<function call\> construction since
it may make the code less readable. Provide the comment for non-obvious
cases instead.

Project-Dependent Standards
===========================

Individual projects may wish to establish additional standards beyond
those given here. It is good and recommended practice to define on a
per-project basis additional naming conventions, including common prefix
conventions, rules for function or data structures grouping,
restrictions to libraries and headers which may be used in project,
preprocessor variables and macros usage, include files organisation etc.

It is highly recommended to make those standards compliant to this one.
